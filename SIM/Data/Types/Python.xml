    <type tid="object" name="object" description="Objects are Python’s abstraction for data. All data in a Python program is represented by objects or by relations between objects." />
    <type tid="null" name="None" description="This type has a single value. There is a single object with this value. It is used to signify the absence of a value in many situations, e.g., it is returned from functions that don’t explicitly return anything. Its truth value is false." />
    <type name="NotImplemented" description="This type has a single value. There is a single object with this value. Numeric methods and rich comparison methods may return this value if they do not implement the operation for the operands provided. " />
    <type name="Ellipsis" description="This type has a single value. There is a single object with this value. It is used to indicate the presence of the ... syntax in a slice." />
    <type tid="boolean" name="bool" description="Boolean type. These represent the truth values False and True." />
    <type tid="s-integer32" name="int" description="Plain integers. These represent numbers in the range -2147483648 through 2147483647." />
    <type tid="s-real32" name="float" description="Floating point numbers. These represent machine-level double precision floating point numbers." />
    <type tid="s-integer64" name="long" description="Long integers. These represent numbers in an unlimited range, subject to available (virtual) memory only." />
    <type tid="complex" name="complex" description="Complex numbers. These represent complex numbers as a pair of machine-level double precision floating point numbers." />
    <type tid="string" name="str" description="ASCII strings. The items of a string are characters. There is no separate character type; a character is represented by a string of one item. " />

    <type tid="string" name="unicode" description="Unicode strings. These represented by a Unicode object of one item and can hold either a 16-bit or 32-bit value representing a Unicode ordinal." />

    <type name="buffer" description="The buffer object will be a slice from the beginning of object." />
    <type name="xrange" description="The xrange type is an immutable sequence which is commonly used for looping." />
    <type tid="set" name="set" description="A set object is an unordered mutable collection of distinct hashable objects." />
    <type name="frozenset" description="A frozenset object is an unordered imutable collection of distinct hashable objects." />
    <type tid="dictionary" name="dict" description="A mapping object maps hashable values to arbitrary objects. These represent finite sets of objects indexed by nearly arbitrary values." />
